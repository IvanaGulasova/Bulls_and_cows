## Bulls and Cows is a code-breaking game or a number guessing game. The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number in a certain number of attempts. For each guess, the player is given feedback in the form of the number of "bulls" and "cows" they have. A "bull" represents a correct digit in the correct position and a "cow" represents a correct digit in the wrong position. The player must use this information to make their next guess and try to correctly guess the number in as few attempts as possible.
